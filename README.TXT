AUDIENCE

This project is mainly addressed to developers and tech enthusiasts, with the aim of becoming more and more friendly for everyone's use.
If you like this project and want to contribute, you can do this in many ways: sending feedback; reporting bugs; fixing bugs; improving/adding features; beta testing; suggesting new features; donating.


MISSION

* Developing an easy to use and generic purpose Home Automation Server that will have highly extensible/programmable features
* Giving a concrete common language "chance" to all "connected" devices and standards, humans included =)
* Building a "Do It Yourself" HG server box, based on Raspberry Pi, with integrated LCD, touch UI, user-selectable Display Widget and also supporting pluggable HW add-ins (1-wire sensors and other easy to plug devices) via a Common eXpansion Port
* Making HG boxes "talk" each other and interoperate

Some of these goals have been already accomplished (see CURRENT FEATURES).

Other expected features:
- Support for other multimedia wireless standards (eg. Bluetooth, DLNA, AirPlay)
- Generic I/O Device Wireless Router and Framework (see MIG)


CURRENT FEATURES

* Modern, web based, responsive UI
  use it on every device, from desktop PCs to smart phones and tablets

* Integrated drivers for X10 and Z-Wave devices
  ready to use solution for your home automation

* Real and virtual energy metering with statistics
  energy consumption awareness for optimizing costs and usage

* Wizard Scripting
  no need to be a programmer, create scenarios with your fingers using the "live macro recording" feature

* Automation Program Plugins (APPs)
  easily add/share new automation programs and features

* Localization
  English, Italian, Spanish, French, Netherlands. Other languages can by added by creating a simple JSON file.

* Password protected access

* Configuration backup/restore and factory reset

* Embeddable
  runs on low-energy and low-cost embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi

* Customizable widgets and features
  create new features and widgets that interact with your devices and internet services

* Programmable Automation Engine
  web based Program Editor and compiler with multi-language support: C#, Javascript, Phyton and Ruby

* Dynamic Web Service API and Helper Classes
  make your devices and services talk each other using a common language over the net

* Direct access to Raspberry Pi hardware
  GPIO, SPI, I2C programming using an event driven model

* Virtual modules

* Speech recognition / Voice Control (using Web Speech API)

* Speech synthesys (cloud based)

* Programmable InfraRed transceiver
  use a common IR remote to control your automation system

* Video4Linux camera video driver
  use a webcam as a remote monitoring device

* Mobile app clients (Android, Windows Phone)

* Open Source (last but not least)
